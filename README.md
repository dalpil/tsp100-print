# tsp100-print

A small utility for sending raster images to LAN-connected Star Micronics TSP100LAN / TSP143 receipt printers.

The program expects bilevel images, at most 576 pixels wide, and it will complain if you try to feed it anything else.

If no printer is specified, the program will try to autodetect a printer on the network.

The program will do its best to verify that the printjob completed sucessfully, by using the document start/end commands, as well as using the ETB-counter to detect a sucessful print.

See the [STAR Graphic Mode Command Specifications, Rev. 2.32](https://starmicronics.com/support/Mannualfolder/star_graphic_cm_en.pdf) for detailed information on how to talk to these printers.


## Usage example

    $ tsp100-print <printer-ip> <input.png>

## Usage instructions

    Usage: tsp100-print [OPTIONS] PRINTER_IP INPUT

      This is a small utility for sending raster images to Star Micronics TSP100 /
      TSP143 receipt printers.

      The program expects bilevel (black and white) images, at most 576 pixels
      wide. Wider images will be cropped.

    Options:
      --cut / --no-cut                Whether or not to cut receipt after printing
                                      [default: cut]
      --density INTEGER RANGE         0 = Highest density, 6 = Lowest density
                                      [default: 3; 0<=x<=6]
      --dither [NONE|FLOYDSTEINBERG]  [default: NONE]
      --margin-top INTEGER            [default: 0]
      --margin-bottom INTEGER         [default: 9]
      --resize-width INTEGER          Resizes input image to the given width while
                                      preserving aspect ratio
      --speed INTEGER RANGE           0 = Fastest, 2 = Slowest  [default: 2;
                                      0<=x<=2]
      --help                          Show this message and exit.
